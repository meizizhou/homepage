	I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/departments/information-decision-sciences-department" target="_blank">Department of Information and Decision Sciences</a> at <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/" target="_blank">Carlson School of Management</a>, <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>. My research focuses on algorithmic and economic aspects of IT-enabled platforms in the areas of recommender systems and healthcare markets. As part of algorithmic explorations, I combine machine learning, deep learning and simulation to understand and improve recommender systems performance in the settings where traditional modeling assumptions do not hold due to the real-world bias, privacy, and item life length considerations. To explore the economic impact of IT platforms, I combine randomized controlled trials, quasi-natural experiments, econometric analyses, and machine learning to study the effects of personalized recommendations on product category expansion as well as the effects of telehealth adoption. My studies have won <em>Best Paper Award</em> at <em>ZEW Conference 2021</em> and <em>Best Student Paper Award</em> at <em>INFORMS Workshop on Data Science 2020</em>.

	Prior to graduate school, I obtained my master's degree at <a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, and bachelorâ€™s degree at <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">Renmin University of China</a>. I have worked as research intern at companies such as Best Buy, JD.com, and Tencent. My internship relevant research have been published on top computer science conferences including WSDM and CIKM.
