	I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/faculty-research/academic-departments/information-systems/" target="_blank">Information Systems department</a> at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/" target="_blank">Questrom School of Business</a>, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a>. My research focuses on algorithmic and economic aspects of IT-enabled platforms in the areas of recommender systems and healthcare markets. As part of algorithmic explorations, I combine machine learning, deep learning and simulation to understand and improve recommender systems performance in the settings where traditional modeling assumptions do not hold due to the real-world bias, privacy, and item life length considerations. To explore the economic impact of IT platforms, I combine randomized controlled trials, quasi-natural experiments, econometric analyses, and machine learning to study the effects of personalized recommendations on product category expansion as well as the effects of telehealth adoption. My studies have won <em>INFORMS Information Systems Society (ISS) Nunamaker-Chen Dissertation Award Winner 2023</em>, <em>Best Paper Award</em> at <em>ZEW Conference 2021</em> and <em>Best Student Paper Award</em> at <em>INFORMS Workshop on Data Science 2020</em>.
